wanders off
wanders off around sky city
wants chocolate
wants everyone to be friends
wants more
wants proof * is not merely a self-aware perl script
wants the future now
wants time to go faster so a rotten day can end
wants to be friends with everyone
wants to get BaBs sewn up for the next six months
wants to live entirely within the cloud
was ctcp'd
was disappointed with his pies
was expecting * to say 'run up testdrive and find out for yourself, you lazy git'
was going to say -ot but remebered the adage of gates and bolting horses
was here first
was just wondering if nofx had any exciting news to report
was misled
was near chez * this afternoon
was near the previous chez *
was not aware of making a pop culture reference
was not of a fan of lugradio
was out walking with a friend around pewley down and the chantries
was the first year to do gcse :)
was under the impression * was 8ft tall
was waiting for * to claim he does not actually live in guildford
was waiting for the answer from * ;)
washes clothes
wasn't aware he was using a fake internet
wasn't paying attention
watches *
watches * watching anaconda merge /usr
watches the rain
watches the world go by
watches vnstat
waves
waves his antennae furiously
waxes lyrical
wears his oggcamp t-shirt
wears the present on his head
whistles
wields his barcode scanner
will attempt to tell *, who will have nodded off before the telling is complete
will be bringing a tin of spam
will be calling on *'s scripting skillz shortly

will do his bit
will do no such thing
will do nothing

will have nothing to do with it
will have to give soda bread a try
will have words
will hold * responsible if this does not happen
will hold * to that
will inform * of this decision
will keep on going
will let someone else de-karma * for not using bitfolk ;)
will likely visiting the opera house, not a bunker house
will man the barracades
will never trust * again
will not
will not attend
will not go
will not greet * in light of that comment
will not inquire further
will not say hello to *
will now plague * daily for configuration help ;)
will now tell everyone that * skives
will prove it the old fashioned way :)
will shortly be consuming sardines on toast
will shout at the sky
will spend the evening considering whether * is a threat to everything we hold dear
will stay home and grizzle
will stay home and polish his boots with the cat
will stick to drinking pimms ;)
will stick with a netbook
will stick with skype ;)
will take any friends he can get
will talk to * instead
wins
wishes * were back in his office
wishes a bad day on *
wishes a leaky roof on *
wishes a poor internet connection on *
wishes everything wasn't deeply intertwingled
wishes he could find a more accurate temperature feed
wishes purgatory on *
wishes seasonal cheer to *
wishes to quiz * on the mechanics of WoW
wishes to see peer reviewed evidence to that effect
